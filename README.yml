## Abstract

Crowdfunding is a certain way of raising funds where individuals come 
together and collectively support projects by investing in them. 
Kickstarter is one of the leading crowdfunding platforms in the world 
that helps individuals/businesses in various categories such as art, 
film, music, theatre, games, design, and other, to raise necessary funds 
to complete their projects. This paper explores the utilization of big 
data technologies and cloud services such as MongoDB, virtual machines, 
MongoDB Atlas, DigitalOcean, AWS, and PyMonogo while analyzing the 
Kickstarter Projects dataset obtained from the Kaggle datascience 
platform.
